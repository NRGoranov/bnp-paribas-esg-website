# ESG Risk Integration - Presenter Notes

## Slide 1: Hero - ESG Risk Integration
**Key Points:**
- Strategic project serving as both "risk defence" and "value creation" engine
- Ensures regulatory compliance and manages new ESG-related risks
- Improves product pricing and meets growing investor demand
- Addresses sustainable products market requirements

## Slide 2: The Project Goal
**Strategic Drivers:**
- **Risk Defence** - Ensure regulatory compliance and manage ESG-related risks
- **Value Creation** - Improve product pricing and meet investor demand
- **Market Positioning** - Address growing demand for sustainable products
- **Competitive Advantage** - Clear, auditable decisions on product approval

**Presenter Notes:**
- This is a strategic initiative, not just compliance
- Dual purpose: defensive and value-creating
- Addresses both regulatory and market pressures

## Slide 3: Our Solution - ESG Risk Compilation Survey
**What it is:**
- A proprietary scoring model (scorecard) that quantitatively evaluates insurance products
- Point-based questionnaire for internal use
- Generates numerical scores for compliance level assessment

**What it does:**
- Shows product's compliance level with Cardif's sustainability requirements
- Enables clear, auditable decisions on product approval and pricing
- Provides quantitative evaluation framework

**Presenter Notes:**
- This is our proprietary internal methodology
- Focus on quantitative, auditable results
- Clear decision-making framework

## Slide 4: The Four Core ESG Criteria
**Visual: 4-Panel Framework**
1. **Environmental Sustainability (ES)** - Environmental impact, climate change risks, resource use, biodiversity
2. **Social Inclusion (SI)** - Product accessibility, discrimination prevention, data privacy
3. **Responsible Investment (RI)** - Greenwashing risks, regulatory compliance (SFDR), stranded assets risks
4. **Shared Value Initiative (SVI)** - Charitable/social contributions integrity, cause-washing protection

**Presenter Notes:**
- Four custom criteria defined specifically for this project
- Each criterion addresses specific ESG risk areas
- Comprehensive coverage of sustainability requirements

## Slide 5: How It Works
**Visual: 3-Step Process**
1. **12 Core Indicators** - Binary Yes/No questions
2. **Weighted Alignment Score** - Strategic weights applied
3. **Compliance Rating** - Final score out of 100

**Presenter Notes:**
- Simple 3-step process
- 12 indicators across 4 criteria
- Generates final compliance score
- Immediate rating based on thresholds

## Slide 6: Implementation Plan (5 Phases)
**Visual: 5-Phase Timeline**
1. **Solution Modeling** - Establishing the framework, core strategic priorities and criteria selection
2. **Implementation** - Embedding the score system into the product pricing policy and composition of the Survey tool
3. **Product Assessment and Scoring** - Testing the methodology with a specific insurance product and adjusting the criteria and the scoring
4. **Underwriting & Pricing Decision** - Using the tool for commercial and risk decisions when developing new products
5. **Review & Improvement** - Maintaining the model and ensuring it is aligned with the current regulatory standards and ESG risk criteria

**Presenter Notes:**
- 8 weeks for core execution
- 5 internal employees dedicating 20% of their time
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Focus on practical implementation and testing

## Slide 7: Key Stakeholders
**Visual: 4 Stakeholder Groups**
1. **Executive Committee** - Sponsor and approver
2. **Steering Team** - Implementation team
3. **ESG Compliance Team - Paris** - Data provider
4. **BNP Paribas Cardiff Clients** - End users

**Presenter Notes:**
- Each stakeholder has specific role and impact
- Executive Committee has highest impact (Go/No-Go)
- Paris team provides mandatory ESG data

## Slide 8: Key Risk Impacts
**Visual: 2 Critical Risk Cards**
1. **Materiality Consensus Risk**
   - **Impact:** If the methodology lacks consensus, the project delivers an accurate score, but that score is deemed irrelevant or non-material by the business
   - **Consequence:** Leads to neglect and continuation of mispriced ESG risk

2. **Data Scarcity/Quality Risk**
   - **Impact:** If the data is unreliable, the scoring system breaks down or produces inaccurate results
   - **Consequence:** Delays product launches and exposes BNP Paribas Cardif to regulatory fines for incorrect ESG product classification (Greenwashing Risk)

**Presenter Notes:**
- These are the most severe impacts that could arise
- Framework Risk vs Operational Risk
- Both can lead to significant business and regulatory consequences

## Slide 9: Project Cost
**Visual: Cost Breakdown Chart**
**Project Details:**
- **Timeline:** 8 weeks for core execution
- **Team:** 5 internal employees dedicating 20% of their time
- **Estimated Cost:** 3,076 BGN to 13,655 BGN
- **Cost Basis:** Labour cost for the project team

**Presenter Notes:**
- Realistic cost estimate based on internal team allocation
- 8-week timeline for core execution
- Cost range reflects different scenarios and team member rates
